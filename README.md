# Calendary

**Project Description: Calendary.com.ua**

Calendary.com.ua is an innovative online service designed to allow users to create personalized calendar posters with ease. The platform enables users to register, select twelve custom images (one per month), add significant dates, and customize the language and start day of the week for their calendar. Once finalized, users can proceed with an order that generates a high-quality PDF sent directly to the print service, ensuring their personalized calendar is produced and delivered to their specified address.

The platform offers a straightforward user journey, beginning with an intuitive interface that guides users through each step of customization. Calendary.com.ua includes functionalities for uploading images, setting key dates, and selecting language preferences. The calendar is organized around a seamless shopping cart experience, where users can add multiple calendars, modify quantities, and proceed to a secure checkout. Integration with local shipping (e.g., Nova Poshta) and payment gateways like Mono API ensures that the ordering process is quick, convenient, and locally accessible.

For added convenience, Calendary.com.ua also includes an admin panel for streamlined order management. Here, admins can view detailed order information, update statuses, and send the final files directly to printing services. Designed with flexibility and personalization in mind, this project not only meets a practical need but also brings a touch of creativity to users' everyday lives, making it a unique platform for anyone looking to capture memories and important events in a custom-designed calendar.
